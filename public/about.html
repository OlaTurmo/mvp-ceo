        <h2>Why We Created MVP.CEO</h2>
        <p>We built MVP.CEO because 99% of startups fail before launching. We were frustrated by scattered tools, slow execution, and the lack of AI-driven guidance.</p>
        
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>To empower dreamers, disruptors, and founders to bring ideas to lifeâ€”faster, smarter, and with confidence.</p>
        
        <h2>Join the Movement</h2>
        <p>We are building a tribe of startup builders who believe in action over hesitation. Be part of the revolution today.</p>
